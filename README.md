## 👨‍💻 About Me

Born into a dedicated Air Force family (Air Commodore and Mrs. Hafsat Zakari) in Plateau State, Nigeria, my life has been a series of disciplined moves and intellectual explorations across the country—from Jos and Abuja to Enugu, Osun, and Uyo. 

I’ve always been obsessed with **building stuff**. Whether it was my "B Class" Science and Technical education in Uyo or my brief time studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering at AFIT, my path has always pointed toward one goal: **Mastering the intersections of Lead, Design, and Technology.**

Now, as a Midshipman at the **United States Naval Academy**, I am refining my skills in Robotics and Control Engineering to build the systems of the future.

## 🏗️ The Curriculum (Project Hub)

This repository uses **Git Submodules** to unify my specialized projects. Each folder below is a live link to its own dedicated repository:

| Project Module | Description | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🐍 **[Python Foundations](./python-foundations)** | Core logic, algorithms, and automated testing fundamentals. | Python, Unit Testing |
| 🎮 **[Pygame Masterclass](./pygame-masterclass)** | Interactive graphical applications and game engine logic. | Pygame, OOP |
| 📟 **[Raspberry Pi Pico](./raspberry-pi-pico)** | Physical computing, sensor integration, and real-time control. | MicroPython, Hardware |
| 🚀 **[Physics Simulations](./physics-simulations)** | High-fidelity simulations including missile guidance and radar systems. | Numerical Methods, Physics |
